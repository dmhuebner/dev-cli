##### A Node.js CLI template project.

This is a nice and quick way to get up and running with a new Node.js CLI app. Its pretty straight forward, has zero npm dependencies, and can easily be expanded upon.

This template is designed to use events to handle user input.


To get started:  
1. Add your cli commands and command descriptions to the commands object in **lib/commands.js**.
2. Add *input event handlers* and *event responder* functions to **lib/cli.js** for each of your commands.
