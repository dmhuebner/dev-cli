##### {%projectDescription%}

This project is designed to use events to handle user input.


To get started:  
1. Add your cli commands and command descriptions to the commands object in **lib/commands.js**.
2. Add *input event handlers* and *event responder* functions to **lib/cli.js** for each of your commands.
