# {%projectTitle%}
#### {%projectDescription%}

This project uses MongoDB and Mongoose to manage data.

It includes scaffolding for all HTTP request actions for example '{%firstModelLowerCase%}' data.

The examples in this template use the error back pattern but any other design pattern can be used instead.

#### To get started:
  1) Add your own models, controllers, and routes.
  2) Remove or replace the first '{%firstModelLowerCase%}' model, controller, and route if needed.

#### To run locally:
You'll need to download MongoDB to run locally.

Download dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run MongoDB locally:
```
mongod
```

Run locally for development:
```
npm run develop
```
