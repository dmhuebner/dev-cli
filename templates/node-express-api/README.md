#### {%projectDescription%}

This project uses MongoDB and Mongoose to manage data.

It includes scaffolding for all HTTP request actions for example 'foo' data.

The 'foo' examples in this template use the error back pattern but any other design pattern can be used instead.

#### To get started:
  1) Add your own models, controllers, and routes.
  2) Remove or replace the example 'foo' model, controller, and route.

#### To run locally:
You'll need to download MongoDB to run locally.

Download dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run MongoDB locally:
```
mongod
```

Run locally for development:
```
npm run develop
```
